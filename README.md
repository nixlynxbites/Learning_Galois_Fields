# Working Repository

This is a repository for working on the problems and exercises found here https://xorvoid.com/galois_fields_for_great_good_00.html

# Dependencies

The Tests use utest.h (https://github.com/sheredom/utest.h) Commit 97236c14007916ebb4522d7e7290c242cc372d41  
utest.h has been slightly patched, so it will build even if custom types are used with it  
(The Patch is a Hack that just ifdefs out the failing parts)
